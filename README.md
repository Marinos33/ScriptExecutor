# ScriptExecutor

A simple desktop application which allows you to launch a batch code when a specific software is shutdown.
This app was originally design to auto-backup the save files of some game after shutdown.

## How it works
First, click on "Add Game" to add a game to the list of software to observe.

Then, add the name of the software, the exe file to observe (either type directly the name of the software or find it with the file explorer)
and finally, write the code you want to run.

Once this is done, if you launch the program previously enter and close it, the script should run.

The app stays in system tray if you close it with the cross on the top-right.
