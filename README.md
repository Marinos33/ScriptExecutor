# ScriptExecutor

A simple desktop application which allows you to launch a batch code when a specific software has been launch,shut down or both. This app was originally design to auto-backup the save files of some game after shut down.

## How it works
First, click on "Add Program" to add a game to the list of software to observe.

Then, add the name of the software, the exe file to observe (either type directly the name of the software or find it with the file explorer)
then write the code you want to run and finally, choose whether you want to run it on shutdown of the program, when the progam is launched or both.

Once this is done, the code you have previously typed will run accordingly to your wish.

The app stays in system tray if you close it with the cross on the top-right.
